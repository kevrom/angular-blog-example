## Angular.js Blog Example, with a Koa API / RethinkDB database

Frontend
- Angular.js
- Angular-UI-Router
- Restangular

Backend
- Koajs
- RethinkDB

Install RethinkDB
Navigate to the control panel. It should be at `localhost:8080` with default options.
Create a database named `blogtest`
Create a table in that database called `blogs`

Install gulp globally, `npm install -g gulp`

Then start the server by typing `gulp`

This isn't some complete project, just a quick example of said technologies.
